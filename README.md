# Tests-in-Time-Series
To understand time series there are many tests involved. Some of them are Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test which will let us know if data is stationary or non stationary. Second, Grangerâ€™s Causality Test.This test will help to conclude if there is any causality involved between variables. Eg: Y is caused because of X. Lastly, Durbin Watson Statistic.This test will let us know if there is any autocorrelation involved by looking into its residuals/lag residuals.
